            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our greatest joy in having chickens is collecting the softly hued eggs every day. In fact, we enjoy it so much as a family, we had to divide up the week and assign one 'egg collecting' day per person. Sunday is my day. I love going outside as they greet me with their squawks and squeaks. I am their heroin, releasing them from their coop into the wide world of bugs!</p>]]></description>
