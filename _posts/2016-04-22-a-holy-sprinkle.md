A HOLY SPRINKLE

A sprinkle is gentle and quiet. Trampling rain will destroy beginning buds. 

One must return often to the sprinkle of water that cleanses the soul. Washing fast, one time is not an option. The constant sprinkle is our only choice.

In Ezekiel 36, the _sprinkle_ is powerful and cleansing. 

God says to Israel...

__

_**"But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went." **_

__

_**"I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen"**_

__

_**"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you."**_

__

_**"A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh."**_

__

_**"And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them." **_

__

_**"Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations." **_

__

_**"Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel."**_

This precious cleansing is not for the sake of Israel, but for the sake of God's Holy Name. He's ashamed of how Israel has represented Him. He is angry. But out of His anger, came just a sprinkle?

God's answer to sin and shame was to sprinkle them clean, give them new hearts and put His own precious spirit within them. They cursed Him. He blessed them.

Isn't this just like Him? Mercy and goodness bringing holy conviction. All for His names' sake. 

A foreshadowing of His goodness through Jesus. He always wanted it from the beginning- closeness, showering good and putting His holiness into us.

A holiness and a blessing of sprinkled water and sprinkled blood. The kind of cleansing that brings you back for more. A long, slow sprinkle from filth, an enduring sprinkle of holy blood purging sin, bringing blessing.

A sprinkle cleans slow. No forceful torrent came for this group. His plan was long and slow. The blessing came after the cleansing, so that all would know His goodness and...

****

**_"know that he is the Lord."_**

In the Old Testament, when the priest was preparing the alter. He sprinkled the blood of the animal,

****

**_"upon the alter, round about."_**

Hebrews 10:21-22 says...

__

_**"Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water."**_

This sprinkling, this holy cleansing is my "mercy wash" because He took the torrent.

He took the curse and gave me the blessing...

And all for His names' sake!

I return to the sprinkle and savor each drop. His "love wash" sinks deep.

His mercy is so gentle, so penetrating, a constant sanctification.

Stand in it, my dear friends- in the sprinkle. 

Remind yourselves that this is how He restores His Name.
