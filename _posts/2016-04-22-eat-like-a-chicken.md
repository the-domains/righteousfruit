Our greatest joy in having chickens is collecting the softly hued eggs every day. In fact, we enjoy it so much as a family, we had to divide up the week and assign one 'egg collecting' day per person. Sunday is my day. I love going outside as they greet me with their squawks and squeaks. I am their heroin, releasing them from their coop into the wide world of bugs!

Chickens are so quirky and odd, with their little noises and heads cocked sideways to see the worm at their feet. Funny thing about them is, they're constantly eating! If it wasn't for our vast array of grass and plentiful bugs we couldn't afford feeding them. Peck peck peck, **dust bath**, peck peck peck,**lay an egg,** peck peck peck, peck peck peck!

I gather a handful of breakfast and watch them spearing the soil with precision to get the prize (worms.) And I think..."maybe this is how I should eat the Word of God." Do I really get enough? Sitting down to a big dose of the Bible is unattainable, unless I get up at 4am, Ha! Let's not kid ourselves. So I eat little morsels all day long- some in the morning, some in the evening, little post-it-notes all over the house; this is my armor, my strength and my food. I peck through my day like a mother hen, nourishing myself slowly but constantly, showing my children what to eat and how much. Hopefully the Lord will gather my fruit in joy. 

The thing about eating is...you can't eat and talk at the same time. If I spend my minutes eating the Word and dwelling on it, maybe it will help me not to **cluck** so much. Ladies are so good at clucking, with gossip and general 'over use' of words. "Where words are plenty, sin is not absent."

I often tell my children that the Word of God is like our ruler. We can't measure an inch unless we hold up a ruler. We can't decipher truth unless we hold it up to the Word of God. There are so many messages and agendas to process daily, coming from all directions, and many of them sound very Christian and seem very noble. Only the well versed Bible reader will recognize the fallacies. Proverbs says "The ear tries words like the mouth tastes meat." Lies always hold little bites of truth or they wouldn't be convincing. So how can I tell deception from truth? I must guard my heart with the 'armor of the Lord' and listen to that little voice inside called-conscience. "Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee." I must eat like a chicken, all day long, as if my life depended on it...**because my life does depend on it. **

Happy Pecking!
